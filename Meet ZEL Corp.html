                <p> Julia contributed greatly to the first draft of the PURE Writing website for M.T.J.'s social studies assignment. However, after the project was completed and marked, she lost interest in PURE Writing and is no longer apart of it. We at PURE Writing just wanted to acknowledge her imput, because the business might have not been the same without her ideas. </p>

               <p> Zelmera Limited wasn't always Zelmera Limited. This company actually started in a year 10 social studies class as: M.T.J. Limited. The idea for PURE Writing was presented by our CEO (and founder) Talia Feasey, as a potential idea for the "make your own business" project they had to complete and present. Talia's friends, Mahlia Page and Julia Saberon both agreed it was a good idea and together they set out of create a simple Google Sites webiste that would be used to present their idea. It was then presented, marked and then it was lost in the many files of Google Drive, never to be seen again. Or so they thought... </p>
                <p> Year 11, Talia Feasey started a digital technology class with Mahlia. Both of them were excited when they were told they were going to be taught how to make a website (neither of them had done something like this before.) Since it was an individual project, they both choose their own ideas to work around. Mahlia's idea was to build a webiste around a passion of hers: TCK (Thrid Culture Kids), while Talia was inspired to use the idea of PURE Writing and expand on it.</p>
                <p>Since M.T.J. (Mahlia, Talia, Julia) Limited was no longer accurate, Talia decided the company needed a rename. She took her gamers tag "Ellezmera" and turned it into Zelmera Limited.</p>
                <p> From there, the business and company as been growing and improving. </p>
