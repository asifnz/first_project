                <p> Private Lessons are one on one teacher and student sessions where you really crack down on what you could improve on with your writing. You can hire private teachers to teach a certain genre (or area of writing) that you are interested in. Private lessons are highly recommended by our editors and evaluators. 
Our teachers are available any time between 9.30am -  6.30pm on week days and 11am - 5.30pm on Saturdays (as long as they do not already have a booking in that time slot.)</p>
