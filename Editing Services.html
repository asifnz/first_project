                <h1>Editing Services -</h1>
                <p>At PURE WRITING, we provide well trained editors to edit and perfect your work so it is publish-worthy! We have editors who have studied from world renowned universities and who have work experience with some well-known writers. If you are looking to get published, you are in safe hands.</p>
                <p>Before considering hiring an editor, we recommend you have an evaluation meeting with one of our professional writing evaluators. The first meeting is free. They will take a small sample of your work (eg, first chapter of a book you've written), and analyse/ take notes on your writing style, techniques (etc.) A copy of these notes will be given to you and also be forwarded to an editor if you desire to see one. The evaluators will access whether or not it is a good idea to see an editor and they may recommend that you attend one of our twenty courses or hire a private teacher. </p>
                
                <h3> Our Rates: </h3>
                <h4>Evaluation -</h4>
                <p>Your first meeting is free. Otherwise the cost of an evaluation could be up to $15</p>
                <h4>Editing -</h4>
                <p>Simply book an appointment, give us a brief of the piece of work you would like to be edited and we can link you up with one of our editors who specializes in your particular genre/writing style.</p>
